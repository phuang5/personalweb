<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011656117"> Spatial Heterogeneity Can Lead to Substantial Local Variations inCOVID-19 Timing and Severity</a></strong>(<em>PNAS</em>2020)</p>

{% include image.html url="../images/combfig1.jpeg" caption="" height="250px" align=thumbnail %}
Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Using a diffusion model based on interpersonal contact networks, this paper shows that the spread of COVID-19 has distinct timing and severity across different parts of a city. The paper demonstrates that spatial heterogeneity can produce dramatic differences in social exposures to those with the illness, and stress local healthcare systems differently in timing and extremity. <br>
