Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Using a diffusion model based on interpersonal contact networks, this paper shows that the spread of COVID-19 has distinct timing and severity across different parts of a city. The paper demonstrates that spatial heterogeneity can produce dramatic differences in social exposures to those with the illness, and stress local healthcare systems differently in timing and extremity.
