I am a Sociology PhD candidate at University of California, Irvine, affiliated with the [Networks, Computation, and Social Dynamics Lab], advised by Professor [Carter T. Butts]. Before coming to UCI, I received bachelor's degrees in Sociology and Economics from [Peking University]. <br />

Broadly interested in social relations and population dynamics, I take a relational and structural approach to studying social processes and people's experience therein. My dissertation examines how network dynamics and geopolitical conditions shape internal and international migration, such as the [social and political cleavages behind immobility] of Americans. My second line of research studies the spatial distribution of social relations, and its application in understanding the [diffusion of infectious diseases] such as COVID-19, and the related [health disparity issues]. <br />

My methodological work mainly focuses on developing statistical and computational methods to model network relations and population structures (in dynamic and on a large scale). I study computational methods for [modelling valued/weighted networks], especially for large networks with high edge variance, under the framework of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs). In another project, we employ loglinear models and simulated annealing for imputation of three-way array data, which can be applied to infer distributions of multiple demographic characteristics in small-areal units.

My research is driven by interests in general questions about how people get along with each other in various social and geographical spaces: how we connect with our neighbors? what drives people to leave a place, and what holds on them to stay? where are people moving, and how new and old settlers of a place make sense of their relationships?
I enjoy the insights from formal and relational approaches originated in mathematical sociology, which unveils structural forces and related mechanisms that shape people's experience, behaviors, and perceptions. But I am also a fan of methodological pluralism, appreciative of the rich and unique perspectives we gain from examining social phenomenon at different angles.
A statistician by training, I am a methodologist avid for developing analytical tools to study problems that was deterred by a lack of related methods, which is a common challenge for studies of migration and social networks given the difficulty of information access and their interesting data structures. This interest in methodology also encourages me to think critically when evaluating the research process to make sure methods are properly emlpoyed and interpreted. 


I also develop statistical and computational methods. I develop methods and tools to model large, dynamic, valued networks using the [ERGM] framework, by implementing functions of Maximum Pseudo Likelihood Estimation. In another project, we develop methods to input three-way crosstab data using loglinear models and simulated annealing, which could be employed to estimate the interactions among demographic characteristics in different geographic areas. I also write codes under the ergm framework in R to model network patterns, visualize model accuracy, create formatted regression tables, etc. You can sisit the programming section for more information.
I am also implementing codes, as extension of [ergm.count] package in R, for goodness-of-fit diagnosis and modeling of dependence terms.
